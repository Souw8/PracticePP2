x=8 #we have varriable named x and type of variable is int
y="good" #in this one we have variable y and type of this variable is string
print(x)
print(y)#just printing the results


#variables can be changed 
# for example
num=18
num="age"
print(num)
#first we declared variable num and type is int  but in the next moment we can change whole variable value and its type
#and another way to change variable type
h=18
h=str(18) #in this line we used type casting therefore if we print variable h we can see that output is string
print(h) #result of type casting
#next example for this topic is how to know type  of variable if we dont know it
varr=18
varr1="bro"
print(type(varr))
print(type(varr1))#with function type() we know which type is variable 
# and that all for variables topic
