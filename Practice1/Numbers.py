#There are three numeric types in Python:

#int
#float
#complex
#INT might be all numbers but without dot and this number should be real
x = 12231
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522030303030

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
#FLOAT this type represent all numbers with decimals
x = 1.111
y = 1.22
z = -31.59

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
#COMPLEX Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary 
x = 3+8j
y = 1j
z = -100j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
#and with this we finish our topic numbers
