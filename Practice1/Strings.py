#Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

#'hello' is the same as "hello".

#You can display a string literal with the print() function:
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)
#in this example we have multistring this can contain many line of words
#next thing we need to talk is strings as arrays
#this means that string can be represent like array 
#for example
word="hello"
print(word[0])#[] with this we take the element spoted in this index and for thi sutiation it will be "h"

for x in "banana":
  print(x) #and like arrays we can walk through all elements of string
