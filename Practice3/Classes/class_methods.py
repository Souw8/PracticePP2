"""Class Methods
Methods are functions that belong to a class. They define the behavior of objects created from the class.

Example
Create a method in a class:
"""
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def greet(self):
    print("Hello, my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("Emil")
p1.greet()
#Multiple Methods
#A class can have multiple methods that work together:

#Example
#Create multiple methods in a class:

class Playlist:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    self.songs = []

  def add_song(self, song):
    self.songs.append(song)
    print(f"Added: {song}")

  def remove_song(self, song):
    if song in self.songs:
      self.songs.remove(song)
      print(f"Removed: {song}")

  def show_songs(self):
    print(f"Playlist '{self.name}':")
    for song in self.songs:
      print(f"- {song}")

my_playlist = Playlist("Favorites")
my_playlist.add_song("Bohemian Rhapsody")
my_playlist.add_song("Stairway to Heaven")
my_playlist.show_songs()
